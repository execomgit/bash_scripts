Strycore's script collection
----------------------------

Author: Mathieu Comandon

This is a collection of shell scripts I've written and that are (or were) useful
at some point. Most of these scripts are written in Bash  and a few are in 
Python. All of them are under a GPL v3 license, unless specified otherwise.

Some of the scripts are written in a quick and dirty way because I needed them 
quickly on rare occasions. Others like the mysql-* series are cleaner and try to
follow scripting best practices.

Comments, criticism and patches are welcome !
