# Kill all zombie processes' parents.
#
# To clean up a zombie process, it must be waited on by its parent.
# Killing the parent should work to eliminate the zombie.
#
# After the parent dies, the zombie will be inherited by init,
# which will wait on it and clear its entry in the process table.
#
# If you have a daemon that is spwaning children that become zombies,
# then the daemon has a bug: a daemon should notice when its children die
# and wait on them to determine their exit status.
