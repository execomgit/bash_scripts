# Set a terminal window title to the given text.
#
# Example:
#
#     terminal-window-title Hello World
#
# If you use zsh, then disable auto title:
#
#   * If you're a typical user, your settings file is  `~/.zshrc`
#   * Edit the file and search for `DISABLE_AUTO_TITLE`.
#   * If the line is in your settings file, but is commented out, then uncomment it.
#   * If the line is not in your settings file, then add the line:
#
#        DISABLE_AUTO_TITLE="true"
#
# If you use iTerm or iTerm2, on OSX, then do this:
#
#   * iTerm → Preferences → Appearance tab → Window & Tab Titles section
#   * Uncheck "Show window number"
#   * Uncheck "Show current job name"
#   * Uncheck "Show profile name"
#
# If you want to set the terminal window title,
# then use the command terminal-window-title.
